#### About the Project
Do you love recipes and food?
Maybe your food life needs a little refresh and you want a custom recipe to make or
share, **___Kal, Lourdes, and Kyle's Recipes___**
has got you covered!

Have fun with our **All Recipes Page** to see a variety of recipes,
ingredients, and tags. See one you can't live without? Then hit the **Star** button on the recipe details, and it will add to the **Favorite Recipes** section!

If you would like to filter by name or tag, go ahead and click the **Find By Name** or **Find By Tag** button.

**Home Button** is in the top left of the screen and will return you to the main screen.

Moreover we have a space for a **user pantry** where users can add all the ingredients in their pantry. The recipe details will allow you to check if you have enough ingredients to cook a recipe. If so, you can click the green cook arrow and **cook a recipe**! This will take away ingredients from your pantry so you don't have to worry about doing your own accounting. Similarly, it'll track how many times you've cooked the recipe. You're welcome.
